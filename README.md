# shinyeggs
 A catalogue of regular vs shiny eggs in Stadium 2.

## Notes
So, all of the shiny eggs look exactly the same... I didn't even bother screenshotting them all. Not sure if that's just the case with shiny eggs, that they use a default tint or what, but clearly it's gonna take some testing. 
Different DVs? OT/Trainer ID? With or without nicknames (currently all nicknamed their species in title-case)? Not sure what it might take, or if there's nothing to be done to influence them, but might be worth screwing around with regular Pokemon to see if anything can be learned about how the tinting system works in general, beyond the anecdotal data spread around the internet over the years.
